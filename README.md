## problem-statement
Our team HackersUnited(014) have chosen the following probelm statement:

Social
In a post-COVID-19 world where face-to-face interaction is no longer the main mode of
communication, how would you revolutionize making new and/or maintaining relationships?

## Short description

### What's the problem?
COVID-19 have had it hard for us to communicate with the others despite having many social media platforms such as Instagram, facebook and Twitter. For instance, a survey conducted and lead by Horigian on 1008 people aged 18-35 reported that 80% of the participants faced some form of depression during the pandemic.  Therefore, there is a need for us to find new innovative ways to revolutionize communication.

### How can our solution help?
SocialTravellers is a python telegram bot which aims to encourage communication among people of similar interest. It uses simple chat features and gamification gamified to promote chatting over the internet which can form new relationships and also maintain them. SocialTraveller will match users with similar interests into group of five. Each group would last for a day and user will be removed from the group. The users will then be invited into new group to meet new people everyday.
